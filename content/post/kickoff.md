I figure it's about time that I try to disseminate some of the information that
I've _hoarded_ through the years. Selfishly, I've found that documenting
something forces me truly understand whatever I'm writing about.

This weblog is split into two primary topics:

* Graphics Programming
* Home Cooking

Why these two? Why not? I care about these two things, so why not share some
information? Especially in the age of COVID-19 (when this blog was born), these
topics intersect more than ever!

## Graphics Programming

By trade, I'm a graphics programmer. Graphics Programming has a rich history of
sharing information through conferences, papers, Twitter, and BLOGS! I hope to
take some of my professional learnings, and share that information to help the
greater community.

Topics of interest:

* GPU Performance
* GPU Architecture
* APIs
* Low-level GPU programming
* Compute
* Post-processing

## Home Cooking

I **LOVE** to cook, along with peripheral home cooking activities, such as
cooking shows, cooking blogs, cook books, and cooking/chef Instagram.

A brief list of my favorite food styles to cook:

* American South - True Southern ingredients can be hard to get in the Bay Area
but I've gotten decent at figuring out good substitutes. Gumbo, etoufee,
jambalaya, po' boys, and of course, red beans and rice; they're all so fun to
cook and eat.

* Italian/Italian-American - "Italian" food is something that I looked to as a
means to an end in college, and really had minimal respect for most of my life.
In the past 3-4 years, I've really come to love and appreciate both Italian and
Italian-American foods. Roman pastas, spaghetti alla colatura di alici,
braciole, etc.

* "Indian" - I put Indian in quotes because the diversity of styles in India is
vast, and most of what we eat in Western countries is a Punjabi/British hybrid.
I like to cook some of the classics from Western Indian restaurants, and some
dishes from my paternal heritage (South Indian) based on some of the recipes
I've been able to extract from my aunties.

* Thai - Recently, I've started to explore cooking Thai food. A couple North
American restaurants ([Jitlada][jitlada], [Pai][pai], [Pok Pok][pok-pok])
have really ignited my imagination about what Thai cooking represents. I just
made some homemade [Sai Ua][sai-ua] that _blew me away_. I'm ready to add this
to my repertoire!
